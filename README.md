# Release
Release folder of all projects.

**Read the [LICENSE](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/blob/master/LICENSE.md) first.**

**Read [GacUI website](http://vczh-libraries.github.io/) or [the mirror website](http://gaclib.net) for more information.**

Download code from [public releases](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/releases) to get the latest stable release. Code from this repo is also usable but I don't make any promise. I will only make a new release when I think the code is ready to update.

## Content of This Project

- **Import** Gaclib source code
  - **Skins** Predefined control templates. You will need to call `vl::presentation::theme::RegisterTheme` to set a default skin before creating any controls. Read [WinMain.cpp](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/blob/master/Tutorial/Lib/GacUILite/WinMain.cpp) for details.
- **Tools**
  - **GacGen32.exe** / **GacGen64.exe** GacUI resource compiler and C++ code generator for x86 and x64
  - **CppMerge.exe** Merge GacUI generated code for x86 and x64 to architecture-independent code
  - **ParserGen.exe** General LR parser to C++ code generator
  - **GacBuild.ps1** Do everything for you if you don't want to understand build steps. This one builds multiple resource xml files at the same time. Read the comment for more information.
  - **GacClear.ps1** Force `GacBuild.ps1` rebuilding all resource xml files for the next time.
- **Tutorial** Sample code
  - **Lib** Static library projects for all tutorials

## Creating a GacUI app using CMake

Third party project for GacUI 1.0: https://github.com/mangosroom/GacUI-CMake-support

This project is not maintained by members in **vczh-libraries** organization.
In the future there could be some mismatch in the file list,
which could be easily fixed.

## Building using vcpkg

You can build and install vlpp using [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) dependency manager:

  - git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
  - cd vcpkg
  - ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh  # ./bootstrap-vcpkg.bat for Windows
  - ./vcpkg integrate install
  - ./vcpkg install vlpp

Source files in the "Import" folder are grouped by different features defined in [CMakeLists.txt](./Import/CMakeLists.txt).

The vlpp port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.
